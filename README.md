# titanic-random-forest
First project using Titanic dataset for proof of concept of several data science ideas.

In this project I clean a basic dataset and fill in missing values using imputation, perform basic statistical analysis for feature selection, and run models
on a cross-validationn to choose the best course for predictive ability.

After a Random Forest Model was chosen, several parameters are hyper-tuned and a final result was printed and submitted to Kaggle.

This sheet proves out some basic concepts of data science:
  -Data Cleaning and dealing with NaN or incorrect values
  -Visualization of Data
  -Feature Selection based on prior knowledge and emerging trends from data
  -Use of common classification algorithms and the assessment of each using CV and KFolds
  -Hypertuning of Models
  -Visualizing function of models to non-programmers
